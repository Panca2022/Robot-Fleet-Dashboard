# Robot-Fleet-Dashboard
Build a Fleet Monitoring Dashboard to visualize real-time data of multiple robots, including their status, battery, CPU, RAM, location, and last update. Use FastAPI/Flask for backend data simulation, React.js for the frontend with a real-time map, and WebSockets for updates.
